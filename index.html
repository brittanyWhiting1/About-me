                <h3>Project Hail Mary </h3>
                <h4>Winner for Best Science Fiction (2021)</h4>
                <p>
                    Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission—and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.

                    Except that right now, he doesn’t know that. He can’t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.

                    All he knows is that he’s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he’s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.

                    His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it’s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery—and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.

                    And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he’s got to do it all alone.

                <h3>Interstellar  (movie)</h3>
                <p>If you like space or anything Sci-Fi you will love this movie. In 2067, a global famine caused humanity to abandon scientific pursuits such as space exploration. Ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is forced to work as a farmer. One day, Cooper experiences a gravitational "anomaly" in his daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that it is engaged in a secret mission to discover an exoplanet capable of supporting life and that he is working on a gravity-equation. He enlists Cooper's help to pilot an exploratory spacecraft with three other scientists - Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia. The crew travels through a wormhole on board the Endurance to pass through to another galaxy. Their mission is to investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua, each of which was previously explored by a NASA scientist-explorer.</p>
